Description: Monitors interfaces for IPv4/IPv6 address changes
 address-monitor is a simple daemon which can monitor network interfaces
 for address changes and launch an external script/helper when a change
 has been detected (the external script can then do things like update
 dynamic DNS entries, etc).
